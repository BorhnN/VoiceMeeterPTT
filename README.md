VoiceMeeterAHK

A autohotkey project to make a PTT and PTM system with voicemeeter.

### Features:

* Push To Talk and Push To Mute with a single hotkey (default: `CapsLock`)
* A shortcut to toggle between PTT and PTM mode (TBI).
* Visual feedback to indicate that Mic is on (Taskbar turning red)
* Visual feedback is indipendent from shortcuts. So user manually toggling the mute button will also work.

Projects initial code was borrowed and merged from:
